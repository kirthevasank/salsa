## SALSA: Shrunk Additive Least Squares Approximations
This is a Matlab implementation of SALSA, a method for high dimensional nonparametric
regression using additive approximations. For more details read our paper below.

### Installation & Getting Started
- Just add the salsa/ subdirectory to your Matlab workspace and you are ready to go.
- Using this library is fairly straightforward. To use with default hyper-parameters
  just run salsa(Xtr, Ytr) where Xtr,Ytr are the training data and labels.
- To modify hyper-parameters read salsa.m
- We have released 12 of the 16 datasets used in the paper. The other 4 datasets are
  not public.
- experiments/realDemo.m demonstrates how to use our method on the datasets.
